# the-mindful-blurb-journal
Journaling app where user makes many micro-entries that add to a daily collection

**Abstract:** 
Practice being mindful with brevity as you write micro-journal entries. This is for those looking to be more present in their day, by letting you get “it” off your chest while helping articulate your state of mind clearly by forcing you to be brief (similar to twitter). The idea is to spend a minute or two at a time, but compile entries by day allowing you to track how your day went. If you are looking for an app that helps collect accurate data of your mental-state over the course of time, this is for you!
**Experience:**
In this first release users will have a form where they will select a subject(school/work, relationships, family, musings, philosophy/ religion, etc), a mood, and write about their thoughts at the moment. The app will automatically timestamp the record and post it to the users wall.
Users land on their current day’s wall, where all their posts will display in chronological order, or show “No posts today”. There will be a form button where the user can record their entry and post to the db. There will also be a jump to date toggle, where users can jump to a particular date.
There will also be a search function where users can filter by topic, mood, or search subject lines for entries. This will display chronological.  
Users will be able to see graph metrics through chartsjs data visualization and future implementations may add markdown ability to the body of posts using markedjs library.
